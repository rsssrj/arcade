# Arcading

## Game Description
The objective of this project is to develop a game where players strive to accumulate mass by consuming smaller blobs, both non-player and player-controlled, while evading larger blobs that pose a threat of consuming the player's own blob. 

To do this, we've implemented **player.cpp**, **player.h** files and **npc.cpp, npc.h** files for dictating the movement of the player and npc blobs respectively. The player blob is controlled by the user. The **game.h, game.cpp** files combine these movements together on the screen and, **arcade.cpp** is the main file which makes the entire program run.

## Compilation
To compile this project, type make and then **./arcade** in the terminal. Then, move your mouse to move around and try to accumulate as much mass as possible.
